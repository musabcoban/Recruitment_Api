  @hvv
  #Scenario: When the admin sends a get request with invalid input the status code has to be 404
    #Given admin connects to the "/api/admin/candidate" end point with an invalid candidate ID
   # Then admin verifies that the Status Code of the response is 404
    #Then admin sees the message "Could not find given subject id"
